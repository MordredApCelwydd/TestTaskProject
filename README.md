Tsukat test task project!  

Player controls:  
Arrow keys - movement;  
Space - killing an enemy;  
Spawn button - spawning an enemy;  

1. Player hit indication is implemented through animation; player movement and attacks are also animated with the use of animation layers and avatar masks, similar to enemies.
2. Character control is implemented using the New Input System and a physics-based approach.
3. The camera system is implemented using Cinemachine.
4. Enemy pathfinding is implemented using AI Navigation.
5. A custom-written object pooling system is implemented for enemies and projectiles.
6. Both the player and enemies use a shared Animated.cs script thanks to the use of interfaces.
7. XML documentation is provided for classes and key methods.
